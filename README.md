- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZackeryPerski
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and computer engineering technology. I've worked as a teacher in various K-12 schools as a Computer Science teacher, I've taught at various non-profit programs, and have been a First Robotics Coach.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning artificial intelligence and machine learning, and working as a graduate assistant to build practical experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything! Outside of teaching, I also work in robotics, microcontrollers, full stack software development (focusing on ReactJS, Spring, and Postgresql), and Unity game development.
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is via email at zperski@emich.edu.
